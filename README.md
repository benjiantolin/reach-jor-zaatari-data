# General Infrastructure Data

<img src="https://github.com/impact-initiatives/reach-jor-zaatari-data/raw/master/photos/geo-data.jpg" height="140px" alt="Geo Data">

The following data is used to create general infrastructure maps, as well as specialized thematic infrastructure maps, such as health and education. They are available in multiple formats depending on your use case. All Shapefiles are saved in UTM 37N projection. KML, GeoJSON, and CSV coordinates are stored in WGS84 projection.

Location data for households is collected by UNHCR, and tank / connection info is generated by implementing partners in the following districts:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">ACTED</th>
      <th colspan="2">JEN</th>
      <th colspan="4">OXFAM</th>
      <th colspan="6">ACTED</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>10</td>
      <td>11</td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>  
</table>

At the source, data is stored at the household level. Multiple households are all connected to a single septic tank, and multiple septic tanks to a steel tank. The household data is aggregated to the septic and steel tank level to better view those higher level relationships.

# Web Maps

https://zaatari-maps.reach-info.org

This links leads to the Za'atari Maps application. The maps are mobile friendly, location aware, use offline technologies for Android (Service Workers), and and iOS (App Cache), and provides Arabic translations. Use the menu on the left to select from the themes listed below, the info button to switch languages, and the layers button on the far right for the map legend and filter items. Map themes:

- [Districts](https://zaatari-maps.reach-info.org/#/districts)
- [Blocks](https://zaatari-maps.reach-info.org/#/blocks)
- [Wastewater Network](https://zaatari-maps.reach-info.org/#/waste-water)

# Using Offline

## Android

To use the app offline on your Android device, select "Add to Home screen" from the Chrome menu. After this, the app is saved to your phone and will be available even without a network connection.

</div>

## iOS

Similarly, to install the app for iOS devices, use "Add to Home Screen" from the share icon in Safari. After opening up the app for the first time from the home screen, allow a minute for the data to fully download. Otherwise, when accessing it offline, you will receive the warning "Cannot Open Zaatari Maps".

</div>

## MAPS.ME

If your device is not updated to display the app properly, you can import the source data into an existing application such as MAPS.ME. Click the KML download links listed above with your phone, and this will load the files into the application. If you would like to delete or turn off downloaded layers, you can do so from the Bookmark Manager screen.
